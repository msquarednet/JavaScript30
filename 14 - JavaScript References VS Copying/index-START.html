    // start with strings, numbers and booleans (byVal)
    let age = 100
    let age2= age
    // console.log(age, age2)
    age = 101
    // console.log(age, age2)

    // Let's say we have an array (byRef)
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players
    // console.log(players, team)
    players[0] = 'ZAP'
    // console.log(players, team)
    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!
    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.concat()  
    // or  .slice()
    // or [].concat(players)
    // console.log(players, team2)
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team3 = [...players]
    players[0] = 'shazbot'
    // console.log(players, team3)
    const team4 = Array.from(players)
    players[0] = 'freak-a-zoid'
    // console.log(players, team4)

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object
    const person = {name:'Clark Kent', age:34}
    const hero = person
    person.title = 'Superman'
    // console.log(person, hero)
    const hero2 = Object.assign({}, person, {title:'Supertastic Man!'})
    console.log(person, hero2)
    ///const hero3 = {...person} maybe in the future ???
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
